**MeshCore SAR** ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application ("App").

## Information We Collect

We **do not collect, store, or share any personal information**. MeshCore SAR does not require you to sign in, create an account, or provide any personal data. All app functionality operates entirely on your device and through the local MeshCore mesh network.

## Data Storage and Access

All data you create, send, or receive through MeshCore SAR remains **on your device and within the local mesh network**. We do not transmit or access your messages, location data, contacts, or any other information to external servers.

### Local Mesh Communication

Messages and location data are transmitted only through the **MeshCore LoRa mesh network** between devices you've paired with. This communication:
- Occurs peer-to-peer or through mesh repeaters
- Does not route through the internet or cellular networks
- Is not stored on any centralized servers
- Remains within your local mesh network

## Third-Party Services

MeshCore SAR does **not** use third-party analytics, advertising networks, or tracking tools. No information is shared with external services.

## Location Data

MeshCore SAR uses GPS location data to provide position tracking and navigation features. This location data:
- Remains on your device
- Is only shared with other devices on your local mesh network when you choose to transmit it
- Is not sent to any external servers or services
- Can be controlled through the app's settings

## Children's Privacy

MeshCore SAR does not knowingly collect or process any data from users of any age, including children.
