## Overview

**MeshCore SAR** transforms ordinary smartphones into **off-grid communication tools**.  
It provides **messaging, GPS tracking, and tactical mapping** even when cellular and internet infrastructure fail.

### Key Features

**Off-Grid Networking**  
Operates completely offline using LoRa radios and Bluetooth connection between devices.

**Offline Maps**  
Vector MBTiles maps with multiple layers for complete tactical awareness, cached locally for 30 days.

**Team Tracking**  
Live GPS updates, bearing, distance, and battery telemetry for each member in the field.

## LoRa & MeshCore Technology

**LoRa (Long Range)** enables secure, ultra-low-power communication over kilometers.  
**MeshCore Protocol** extends this by creating a **self-healing, multi-hop mesh** — every node becomes a repeater.

- **Automatic routing & fallback** through other devices  
- **End-to-end encryption** for field-grade security  
- **Adaptive location broadcasting** — only updates when needed  
- **Message persistence & retries** with ACK confirmation  
- **Optimized for battery life**

> MeshCore SAR ensures your message always finds its path — even across mountains or disaster zones.

- **Public Channels** – broadcast updates across nodes  
- **Rooms** – persistent logs (e.g., *General*, *Emergency*)  

### SAR Marker Messages
Easily send geo-tagged alerts:  
*Found Person* • *Fire Location* • *Staging Area* • *Object Found*

Messages appear instantly on the map with delivery tracking (Sent / Delivered / Retrying / Failed).
